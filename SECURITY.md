# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in TIMLG (docs, specs, or future code releases), please report it privately.

- Preferred: open a GitHub issue **without sensitive details** and request a private channel
- If possible, include:
  - reproduction steps
  - affected component
  - impact assessment
  - suggested mitigation

## What not to disclose publicly

Never publish:
- private keys / seed phrases
- signer files
- privileged endpoints or automation
- details that enable fund movement or authority changes
