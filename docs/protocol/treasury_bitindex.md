# Treasury & BitIndex

This page describes the treasury model and the BitIndex concept at a spec level.

## Treasury principles
- Rule-based usage (transparent, predictable)
- Budgets for:
  - infrastructure
  - audits/security reviews
  - ecosystem incentives (if any)

## BitIndex (concept)
BitIndex is a mechanism to:
- track protocol-economic signals,
- define allocation rules,
- reduce incentive shocks over time.

!!! warning
    Operational signers, automation, and privileged infrastructure remain private until hardened.
