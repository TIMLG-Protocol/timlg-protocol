# Tokenomics (TIMLG)

This page defines TIMLG token economics at the specification level.

## Objectives
- Incentivize high-signal, verifiable logging
- Discourage spam and low-quality participation
- Sustain development via treasury rules

## Components (draft)
- **Fees:** when they apply and where they go
- **Rewards:** who gets paid, for what, and when
- **Penalties:** non-reveal, invalid reveal, spam patterns (if applicable)
- **Supply policy:** mint/burn/issuance constraints

!!! note
    We can publish this incrementally: principles → constraints → formulas → implementation.
