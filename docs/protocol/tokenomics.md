# Tokenomics (TIMLG)

This page describes TIMLG token economics at the specification level.

## Goals

- Incentivize high-quality, verifiable logging
- Discourage spam and low-signal participation
- Sustain long-term development via treasury rules

## Sections (to be finalized)

- Supply model (mint/burn/issuance)
- Fees (where they apply, how they are computed)
- Reward distribution (who gets paid, when, and for what)
- Penalties / slashing conditions (if applicable)
- Anti-sybil considerations

!!! note
    Tokenomics can be published incrementally: start with principles + constraints, then formalize formulas later.
