# Status

Live snapshot of where the project stands.

## Current focus
- Documentation polish + spec migration (public)
- Oracle / settlement design (private implementation details)

## Build / deployment
- Docs site: **live** on GitHub Pages
- Deployment pipeline: **GitHub Actions** (MkDocs Material)

## What is public (this repo)
- Whitepaper (web + PDF)
- High-level protocol specs
- Roadmap + status snapshots

## What remains private (by design)
- Private keys, seed phrases, privileged configs
- Production relayer/oracle infrastructure
- Anything that can move funds or sign privileged transactions

## Next milestone checklist

- [ ] Fill Whitepaper (web) with real content sections
- [ ] Expand Protocol Overview into a real spec
- [ ] Tokenomics: publish constraints + first draft formulas
- [ ] Treasury & BitIndex: publish rule outline + governance intent
- [ ] Add diagrams (commit–reveal + settlement)
