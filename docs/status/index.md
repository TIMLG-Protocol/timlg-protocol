## Current focus
- Documentation polish + spec migration (public)
- Oracle / settlement design iteration (private implementation details)

## What is public (this repo)
- Whitepaper (web + PDF)

## What stays private (by design)
- Private keys, seed phrases, privileged configs

- Scripts or configs that can move funds or change authorities

## Next milestone checklist
- [ ] Populate Whitepaper web sections (overview + system model)
- [ ] Define log format + hashing
- [ ] Add timing windows + edge cases
- [ ] Add settlement rules + invariants
- [ ] Add diagrams (commit–reveal + architecture)
