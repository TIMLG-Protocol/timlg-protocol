# Team & Contact

TIMLG is currently developed as a **solo, public-facing R&D effort** (documentation + protocol spec),
with the **implementation repository kept private** until a stable devnet release.

This page exists to make the project **legible and accountable**: who maintains it, how to reach them,
and how security reports should be handled.

## Responsible disclosure (security reporting)

If you believe you found a vulnerability:

1. **Do not publish exploit details** publicly.
2. Contact the maintainer (email above) and include:
   - affected component (docs/spec/implementation, if known)
   - reproduction steps (minimal)
   - expected impact
   - suggested mitigation (if you have one)

We aim to acknowledge credible reports and coordinate a fix before any public write-up.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome once the public repos are ready for it:

- documentation improvements (clarity, diagrams, examples)
- spec review and adversarial thinking (edge cases, invariants)
- tooling suggestions for reproducible devnet demos

If you want to help, start by opening a Discussion describing:
- your background,
- what part you’d like to contribute to,
- and any relevant prior work.
