# Responsible Disclosure

If you believe you found a vulnerability:

1. **Do not** publish exploit details publicly.  
2. Use a private reporting channel if available (GitHub private security reporting), or open a GitHub issue **without sensitive details** and request a private follow-up.

Please include:
- affected component (docs/spec/implementation, if known)
- minimal reproduction steps
- expected impact
- suggested mitigation (if any)

We aim to acknowledge credible reports and coordinate a fix before public disclosure.

!!! warning "Do not share secrets"
    Never include private keys, seed phrases, privileged configs, or operational signer details in reports.
