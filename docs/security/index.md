# Security & Control

This page explains what is intentionally public vs private, and why.

## Public
- Specifications and documentation
- Roadmap and progress updates
- Non-sensitive architecture explanations

## Private (not published here)
- Private keys, seed phrases, and signer infrastructure
- Production relayer/oracle operations and privileged automation
- Anything that can move funds or change authorities

!!! warning "Principle"
    Public documentation must never include anything that enables unauthorized control or fund movement.

## Next steps
- Add a short threat model summary
- Add a responsible disclosure contact
