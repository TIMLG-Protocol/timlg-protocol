# Whitepaper Changelog

## v1.2 (February 22, 2026)
- **Live Audit Infrastructure**:
    - Integrated real‑time token flow analysis and categorical integrity proofs as core evidential layers.
    - Added the Audit Dashboard for decentralized transparency and implementation verification.
- **Protocol Parametrization**:
    - Abstracted volatile technical parameters (fees, windows) to focus the whitepaper on scientific dynamics.
    - Standardized configuration variables (`reward_fee_bps`, `sol_service_fee_lamports`) as on-chain administrative controls.
- **Roadmap Consolidation**:
    - Refined development phases to align with the "Hawking Wall" experiment objectives.

## v1.0-beta (January 25, 2026)
- **Implementation Alignment**:
    - Synchronized the commitment formula with the `SHA256` domain-separated implementation.
    - Enforced deterministic **BitIndex** assignment derived from ticket metadata to ensure statistical coverage.
- **Integrity Mechanisms**:
    - Introduced the **NO-REVEAL burn policy** to eliminate selective disclosure incentives.
    - Defined the round-specific vault architecture and slot-based settlement rules.

## v0.1 (December 18, 2025)
- **Initial Conceptual Draft**:
    - Defined the core Hawking Wall hypothesis and the commit-reveal state machine foundation.
    - Established the dual-treasury architecture for operational and reward-pool separation.
