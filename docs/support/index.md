# Support

If you’d like to support TIMLG Protocol, you can donate on Solana.

!!! note "Donations are optional"
    Donations help fund infrastructure, development, and (future) security reviews.  
    This is **not** an investment and provides **no guarantees, rights, or promises**.

## Solana donation address

Replace this placeholder with a dedicated donation wallet (recommended).

`PASTE_YOUR_SOLANA_ADDRESS_HERE`

## Good practice (recommended)
- Use a **dedicated wallet** for donations (not a personal hot wallet)
- Publish a short donation policy once treasury rules exist
- Never publish private keys, seed phrases, or operational signer addresses here
