# Support

If you’d like to support TIMLG Protocol, you can donate on Solana.

!!! note "Donations are optional"
    Donations help fund infrastructure, development, and (future) security reviews.  
    This is **not** an investment and provides **no guarantees, rights, or promises**.

## Solana donation address

Replace this placeholder with your donation wallet (recommended: a dedicated treasury wallet).

## Good practice (recommended)

- Use a **dedicated wallet** for donations (not a personal hot wallet).
- Publish a short **donation policy** once treasury rules exist (what funds can be used for).
- Never publish private keys, seed phrases, or operational signer addresses here.
