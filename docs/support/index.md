# Support

TIMLG Protocol is an early-stage research + engineering effort.  
If you’d like to support development, you can make an **optional donation** on Solana.

!!! note "Donations are optional"
    Donations help fund development, documentation, infrastructure, and (future) security reviews.  
    This is **not** an investment and provides **no guarantees, rights, or promises**.

## What donations may fund

- Devnet iteration costs (SOL for testing & demo reproducibility)
- Tooling and infrastructure (build/deploy, monitoring, indexing)
- Documentation improvements (diagrams, examples, clarity)
- Security work (threat modeling; later: external reviews)

---

## Transparency (recommended)

- Use a **dedicated donation wallet** (separate from personal wallets)
- Publish a simple **donation policy** (what funds are used for, what is not funded)
- Periodically post **high-level summaries** (e.g., devnet testing / infra / security)
- Prefer **multisig / separation of duties** before any mainnet-like operations

!!! warning "Never share secrets"
    Do **not** publish private keys, seed phrases, or privileged signer details anywhere in public docs.
